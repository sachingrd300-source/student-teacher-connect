/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a role-based security model for an educational application. Access is primarily determined by a user's role (teacher, student, parent) and their relationships to specific data entities. The guiding principle is "Authorization Independence," where authorization context (like a teacher's or student's user ID) is denormalized onto documents to create fast, secure, and understandable rules that avoid complex joins.
 *
 * Data Structure: The database uses a flat structure with top-level collections for each major entity (users, teachers, students, studyMaterials, etc.). Relationships are established through denormalized ID fields within documents (e.g., a `StudyMaterial` document contains the `teacherId` of its author). This structure is optimized for security rule performance.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: A user can only access their own user profile document. Listing or browsing other users is disabled.
 * - Role-Based Ownership: Teachers are the owners of educational content like Study Materials, Tests, and Class Schedules. They have exclusive write access to this content.
 * - Shared Access for Student Data: Data specific to a student, such as Attendance and Performance records, is accessible only by the student themselves and the associated teacher. Access for parents is not implemented due to schema limitations and is denied by default for security.
 * - Student Submissions: Students have the authority to create and delete their own submissions (e.g., DPPSubmissions), while teachers can view and manage them.
 * - Public vs. Private Content: The `studyMaterials` collection contains a mix of public and private content, controlled by an `isFree` boolean flag. Reads are allowed for free content, but writes are always restricted to the owner teacher.
 * - Restricted Listing: To prevent data leakage and ensure performance, broad `list` operations are disabled on most collections. Clients are expected to fetch data via known document IDs or through specific, secure queries.
