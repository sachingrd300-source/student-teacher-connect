    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support EduConnect Pro's requirements for role-based access, real-time updates, and study material management while adhering to the core design principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC, and QAPs. Authorization Independence is achieved through denormalization of authorization-related data (e.g., teacherId on student and parent documents) to avoid `get()` calls in security rules. Structural Segregation is used to ensure that each collection has a homogeneous security posture.  Path-based ownership and membership maps are leveraged for access modeling. All IDs are auto-generated UUIDs.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n*   **Users**: Stores basic user information.  This collection is primarily used for authentication purposes and contains minimal data. The `users/{userId}` path provides a secure and easily managed structure for user-specific data.\n*   **Teachers**: Contains teacher-specific details. The `teachers/{teacherId}` path ensures that teacher data is isolated and accessible only to authorized users.\n*   **Students**: Stores student data, with a `teacherId` field denormalized for authorization. This allows students to be associated with teachers and enables efficient querying and rule creation based on teacher-student relationships.\n*   **Parents**: Contains parent data, including references to both the student and teacher. The `teacherId` is denormalized to grant read-only access based on the teacher-student relationship, thus enabling authorization independence.\n*   **StudyMaterials**: Contains study materials uploaded by teachers.  The `teacherId` ensures that only the teacher who uploaded the material can modify it. This supports the QAP that study materials are owned by teachers and enables secure listing.\n*   **Attendances**: Stores attendance records for students, associated with a specific teacher.  This structure facilitates efficient querying of attendance records by student and teacher.\n*   **TestResults**: Contains test results for students, also associated with the relevant teacher and test. The `teacherId` and `testId` ensure that only authorized teachers can access and modify test results, and that results can be easily queried by student, teacher, and test.\n*   **Batches**: Stores batch information. This collection is managed by teachers to organize their students.\nThis design prioritizes data isolation and role-based access control, aligning with the application's security and scalability requirements."
